# 🧠 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning | SDG 3

This project applies a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. It supports **Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)** by leveraging AI for early diagnosis and better healthcare outcomes.

## 🔍 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features**: Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc.
- **Target**: Diabetes diagnosis (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 💡 ML Approach
- Preprocessing with StandardScaler
- Train-test split (80-20)
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~X%
- High importance features: Glucose, BMI, Age

## 📂 Files
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset
- `report.pdf`: Project report
- `presentation.pptx`: Slides for presentation

## ✅ SDG Impact
Improves early diagnosis of diseases, reducing mortality and improving health services access.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use larger datasets
- Deploy as a web app with Streamlit
- Try other models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
